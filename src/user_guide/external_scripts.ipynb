    "|---|---|---|---|--|\n",
    "|**utility modules and libraries** | `import my_module` in Python, `library(my_library)` in R etc | Most clean, and can be used for highly reusable components that worth the effort to formalize and maintain them. | It can be difficult to keep the modules backward compatible so changes in such modules might make a previous workflow non-reproducible. | It is usually not practical to rerun archived projects just to test compatibility of these modules. |\n",
    "|**include shared configurations or functions** | `python: input='utility.py'` | Easier to maintain than modules, include the same scripts across actions or workflows | Without proper wrapping and testing, such functions tend to be changed easily and break previous workflow | Suitable only for configuration and functions that do not need to be changed. |\n",
    "|**nested workflow**| `sos_run(source=\"file.sos\")`| Allows the separation of a big workflow to multiple smaller workflows maintained in different SoS workflows. Very flexible because the workflows and sources can be determined programmatically.| The workflows should be logically and functionally separated so that changes in one workflow will not break the entire workflow. | Suitable for the creation of large workflows. |\n",
    "|**external commands**| `sh(\"sos run workflow\")` in SoS or `!sos run workflow` in SoS Notebook | Similar to `sos_run` in SoS | Similar to `sos_run` in SoS | Useful for SoS notebooks with standardized sub-workflows |"

    "1. `Ctrl-Shift-Enter` This shortcut **send current line or selected text to the panel cell for evaluation**. This effectively allows you to evaluate content of a cell line by line. This shortcut works for both code and markdown cells. The panel cell will switch to the kernel of the sending cell if the sending cell is a code cell. \n",
    "2. `Ctrl-Shift-t` executes magic `%toc` that **displays the table of content of the current notebook** in the side panel, allowing you to easily navigate within a (long) notebook.\n",
    "3. `Ctrl-Shift-O` (output) **toggles a code cell tag `show_output`** and mark the output with a gray bar to the right of the output area, or toggle a markdown cell tag `hide_output`. The tags will be rendered accordingly in HTML reports generated using sos templates.\n",
    "4. `Ctrl-Shift-v` (paste-table) If you have a table copied from external sources such as HTML page or excel file and if you are inside of a markdown cell, this shortcut **pastes table as markdown code to the current cell**. This allows easy copy of tables to SoS notebook.\n",
    "5. `Ctrl-Shift-m` (markdown) **toggle a cell between markdown and code type**, which can be easier to use than select code or markdown cell type from tool bar.\n",
    "6. `Ctrl-B` toggles side-panel. This is for compatibility with the toc2 extension of Jupyter notebook."
